				Make sure that you have Google Earth Pro Desktop Edition installed-it was used in the last assignment.<br />

				You will be using Google Drive, so make sure you can log into your account.<br />
				Create a folder "MIS202Summative10" to save your work.<br />

				Important: <strong>Before beginning this assignment you should first review the LinkedIn Learning tutorial from '</strong><a href="https://www.LinkedIn Learning/ArcGIS-tutorials/GIS-Web/162136-2.html" class="bg-info text-white" target="_blank"><strong>GIS on the Web</strong></a><strong>'.
Review Chapter 1 for background information.
This assignment is based on Chapter 2-Google Maps Mashups Made Easy.</strong><br />
				This assignment highlights some of the problem solving skills and software tools you have learned in this course:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google Sheets</li>
				<li><a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a>- going away after 12/3/2019</li>
				<li>Google Earth Desktop</li>
				<li>Adobe Connect
                    <br />
				</li>
				<li>General computing and networking skills</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<p><strong>Completing the Project-</strong>Read all instructions before proceeding!</p>
		<p>You will do all of Chapter 2 of the LinkedIn Learning video.&nbsp; Below is a list of particular items to save, make screen shots, or pdfs, or upload to the D2L Assignment folder.</p>

		<p>
			Work with Google Drive to complete the first several sections as indicated below.<br />

		</p>

		<div class=" col-lg-12"><a href="#Exercise01" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">Exercise 1-Cloud Applications-Google Drive</a></div>

		<div id="Exercise01" class="collapse in  col-lg-12">
			<p>
				Each student will do all of the steps.<br />
				Log into D2L to find your Summative10 group and group members.<br />
				Then refer to the <a href="https://eprofessor.azurewebsites.net/helpfiles/virtualmeetingrooms.htm" class="bg-info text-white" target="_blank">Meeting Rooms page</a>, and log into the Adobe Connect web conference room that corresponds to your group number.<br />
				Group members will take turns sharing their screens and showing the group how to do a specific section.<br />
				Pay close attention to the Lynda videos as you complete your work.<br />
				<strong>The group decides which student begins the exercise. 
                    <br />
					That student opens up a blank PowerPoint presentation and creates a title slide with a title of: Google Map Mashup, and a second slide listing the names of all group members who are present.  Note the PowerPoint will be passed around to the different group members as they step through the exercise.  Make sure you know how to upload and download from the File Share pod.
				</strong>
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Google Maps options for map development-With all group members logged into group's meeting room, the first student shares their screen, leads others through the video.  Feel free to also play video on your own computer, if that works better.  This section is for background information. First student uploads powerpoint file to file sharing pod. </li>
				<li>Mapping through Google Drive- the next student leads the group through the video, and they make sure that everyone installs Fusion Tables on their Google Drive. The student makes a screen shot showing Fusion Tables installe in Google Drive, and adds it to the powerpoint presentation.  </li>

				<li>Geocoding with an address and coordinates-import Gas_stations_GrandRapids.xlsx    file into Google Drive,  and then convert it into a Fusion table, then geocode the addresses, and view them on the map (make a screen shot of fusion table)</li>
				<li>Merging your data-In your folder create import the Excel spreadsheet "Gas_prices_merge.xlsx" and merge it into Google Drive Spreadsheet file "Gas Prices".  Create a new Fusion Table named "GasPrices" from the imported "Gas_prices_merge" file.  Then merge the original Fusion Table with the "GasPrices" Fusion Table (make a screen shot of merged fusion table)</li>
				<li>Visualization symbologies-Use 'change feature styles" to create 2 ranges, with red and green icons; modify pop-up windows as indicated, adding $, change cost to price and click any gas station to display the pop-up/info window (make a screen shot of map with red/green icons, zoom to show Grand Rapids area)</li>
				<li>How to analyze your map-apply the 3.72 to 3.75 filter,; create the line chart, summarize the chart, use cost values, count them, sort by cost, change max categories to 18.(make a screen shot of the resulting chart, showing filter box and configure categorical chart window); </li>
				<li>Publishing your work-publish, make map visible, to public on the web.<br />
					Create a new web page with the generated html and javascript code, save the page as <strong>Summative10_GasPrice.html </strong>to your Summative10 web folder.<br />
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Procedural Matters</h2>

			<ol>

				<li>The student doing step 1 creates and shares the initial Google Drive file with all the group members. If there are others in the meeting room, you can use Adobe Connect to share your  screen so that others can see what you are doing.</li>
				<li>When the student completes step 1, they upload a copy of all files to the Meeting Room, or share them in Google Drive, as appropriate. Save the file with a name such as &quot;Step1&quot;. Do NOT put <a href="https://eprofessor.azurewebsites.net/ProjectVS/WhyNot.htm" class="bg-info text-white" target="_blank">spaces or non standard characters</a> in the file name!  The next person completes the next step, using Adobe Connect to share what they are doing and / or to ask for assistance.</li>
				<li>Continue in this method until all steps are done. </li>
				<li>It is advisable to keep notes during this process in order to create the PowerPoint presentation.
                    <br />
					It is even smarter to upload a screen shot showing your Google Maps, Sheets and Fusion tables.
                    <br />
					Feel free to use One Drive for Business, Google Drive or Adobe Connect to work on the PowerPoint presentation together. </li>
				<li><strong>The PowerPoint presentation will consist of a title slide listing all group members, and at least 5 others slides containing a screen shot of the Adobe Connect screen taken during each of the six steps.</strong><br />
					The screen shot would look like the image shown below.<br />
					You can also create slides 
      detailing your group work, the Adobe Connect  meeting, the use of Skype, IM, email or any other tool(s) used to complete this project, but that is not required. </li>
